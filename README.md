# Repa Webshop

Repa is a web application developed by a group of two as a university project during the second semester. It is an online store where users can purchase carrots and carrot-themed merchandise. The project includes various features such as a forum, shopping cart, discount codes, and more. This was our first experience working with the HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL stack, and no frameworks were allowed during development.
